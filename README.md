Inside a transparent box, a vibration sensor, a red LED, a green LED, and an active buzzer are connected to an Arduino board, powered by a battery. 

Here's the challenge: when the game begins, the green LED lights up, signaling your chance to showcase your steady hand. Your task? Carefully move the box from one place to another without disturbing the vibration sensor. Even a slightest shake will trigger the red LED and buzzer, letting you know the game is over. The game restarts after a few seconds.
